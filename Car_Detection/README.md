## Introduction

This project utilizes Haar-like features and artificial intelligence to detect cars, pedestrians, and objects on the road. The detector is capable of automatically identifying and localizing these entities in real-world road scenes, which can be useful for various applications, such as traffic monitoring, autonomous driving, and safety systems.

## Files

The repository contains the following files:

- [Car_and_Pedestrain_Detector.py](Car_and_Pedestrain_Detector.py) - Python script for the car and pedestrian detection using Haar-like features.
- [car.jpg](car.jpg) - Sample image used for testing the car detection algorithm.
- [cars.xml](cars.xml) - XML file containing the trained Haar-like features for car detection.

## Getting Started

To get started with the car and pedestrian detection project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository locally using `git clone [repository_url]`.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Run the `Car_and_Pedestrain_Detector.py` script to perform car and pedestrian detection on the provided image or your custom images.
4. Customize the detection parameters and algorithms in the script to suit your specific use case.
